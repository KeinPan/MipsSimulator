1. This folder contains all files for projectII.
I've already put one MIPSsim inside. If you want to start with a new one:
In terminal, first type :make cl, which will remove the existing file
Then type : make

2. We accept commands in the form as: 
./MIPSsim inputfile outputfile [-Tm:n]
for example, ./MIPSsim inputfile outputfile -T3:11

-> inputfile should be Binary. If there is no such file, we would generate error Message. 
-> outputfile could be a text document. NOTE: If there is no such file, we would create a new file named by this. If there is already an existing file, the content would be overlapped.
-> [-Tm:n] is optional. If not provided or got T0:0 , we would print situation of all the cycles. We require m<n. Also, "-" before "T" can not be omitted.
NOTE: Unlike ProjectI, for ProjectII, we don't accept options like dis/sim.

3.The output should match the Final_output given on webpage, not the early version.

4.I only implemented the instructions given on webpage.Instructions beyond that set would be considered as unknown operations.

5.I coded in C++ and used g++ complier in MakeFile, if the computer doesn't support that complier, try any other complier which supports C++11.

*****VERY IMPORTANT*****:
If using "diff" command to test my result, please add "-b" option.
For example:  " diff Final_output.txt outputfile -b "


"-b" would ignore the differences of end-of-line & tabs.
The reason for that is the output for end-of-line and tabs would differ from operating system to operating systems. I finished my coding work under MacOs, but when put it to linux64 for testing, the diff command gave me mistaching result.
I checked my output and sample output for several times, and ensure they are the same. Not until "-b" option added did the terminal stopped posting mismatching messages. 


If you have any questions about the project or codes, or if there is anything wrong when running my codes, please contact me with the email address given above.



*****HONOR CODE*****
On my honor, I have neighter given or received unauthorized aid on this assignment.
